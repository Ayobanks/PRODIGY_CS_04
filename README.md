🧠 Basic Keylogger (Python)
A simple Python-based keylogger that records and logs keystrokes.
This project is intended for educational purposes only — to help you understand how keystroke logging works under the hood using Python.

🚨 Ethical Notice
⚠️ WARNING:
This program captures keyboard input and stores it in a log file.
Do not use this software on any device without explicit permission. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.
This project is intended solely for learning, personal testing, and security awareness demonstrations.

📦 Features
✅ Records every key pressed

✅ Logs saved in a human-readable .txt file

✅ Lightweight and runs quietly in the background

🛠 Requirements
Python 3.x

pynput module

Install dependencies with:

pip install pynput
🚀 How to Run

Clone or download this repository
Run the script using Python:
python keylogger.py
A file named logger.txt will be created in the same directory, storing all recorded keystrokes.
